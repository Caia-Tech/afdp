**Enterprise-grade AI deployment pipeline with forensic audit capabilities for regulated industries**

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This repository is a demonstration and reference implementation, not an authoritative solution.** AFDP is designed to showcase concepts and architectures for forensic-grade AI deployment pipelines. 

**We encourage you to:**
- 🔧 Build your own custom systems based on these ideas
- 🎯 Adapt the concepts to your specific needs
- 🚀 Improve upon the architecture for your use cases
- 💡 Take inspiration, not implementation

This is one approach among many possible solutions. Use it as a starting point for your own innovation.

## 🎯 Overview

AFDP is a comprehensive microservices ecosystem that combines **forensic-grade audit trails** with **production intelligence learning** for AI/ML deployments. The platform monitors production systems to understand real-world impact sequences, automatically generating training data from actual production patterns while maintaining complete transparency and compliance.

**Key Approach**: AFDP captures cause-and-effect sequences in production, creating ML training datasets that reflect real-world behavior, not just synthetic tests.

**Status**: Active Development with Initial Implementations

## 🏗️ Architecture

AFDP follows a modular microservices architecture, designed to capture production intelligence and convert it into actionable insights:

cd afdp

# Start the notary service
cd services/notary-service
docker-compose up -d

# Run basic example
cargo run --example basic_notarization
```

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Notary Service Documentation](services/notary-service/readme.md).

## 🧠 Production Learning & Training Data Generation

AFDP revolutionizes how organizations understand their production systems by:

### Sequence Tracking
```yaml
Example: API Deployment Impact
1. Deploy new API version (v2.1.0)
2. AFDP tracks sequence:
   - Latency increases by 15ms
   - Error rate spikes to 0.3%
   - Specific endpoints affected
   - User sessions drop by 2%
   - Revenue impact: -$1,200/hour
3. Automatically generates training data:
   - Pattern: "This code change → This production behavior"
   - Labels: Performance degradation, Revenue impact
   - Context: Load patterns, infrastructure state
```

### Training Data Output
- **Causal Sequences**: What happened, in what order, with what impact
- **Real-World Labels**: Actual business outcomes, not synthetic metrics
- **Production Context**: Load, state, dependencies during events
- **Behavioral Patterns**: How systems actually behave under stress

### Use Cases
- Train ML models on real production behavior
- Predict deployment impacts before rollout
- Identify patterns that lead to incidents
- Optimize for actual business metrics, not just technical ones
