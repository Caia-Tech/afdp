**Enterprise-grade AI deployment pipeline with forensic audit capabilities for regulated industries**

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This repository is a demonstration and reference implementation, not an authoritative solution.** AFDP is designed to showcase concepts and architectures for forensic-grade AI deployment pipelines. 

**We encourage you to:**
- 🔧 Build your own custom systems based on these ideas
- 🎯 Adapt the concepts to your specific needs
- 🚀 Improve upon the architecture for your use cases
- 💡 Take inspiration, not implementation

This is one approach among many possible solutions. Use it as a starting point for your own innovation.

## 🎯 Overview

AFDP is a comprehensive microservices ecosystem that combines **forensic-grade audit trails** with **production intelligence learning** for AI/ML deployments. The platform monitors production systems to understand real-world impact sequences, automatically generating training data from actual production patterns while maintaining complete transparency and compliance.

**Key Approach**: AFDP captures cause-and-effect sequences in production, creating ML training datasets that reflect real-world behavior, not just synthetic tests.

**Workflow Customization**: Using Temporal, organizations can define their own collection workflows - what to monitor, when to collect, how to process. Combined with Git's cryptographic properties, this creates an immutable record of not just WHAT was collected, but HOW it was collected, ensuring complete workflow integrity.

**Status**: Active Development with Initial Implementations

## 🏗️ Architecture

AFDP follows a modular microservices architecture, designed to capture production intelligence and convert it into actionable insights:

## 🧠 Production Learning & Training Data Generation

AFDP revolutionizes how organizations understand their production systems by:

### Sequence Tracking
```yaml
Example: API Deployment Impact
1. Deploy new API version (v2.1.0)
2. AFDP tracks sequence:
   - Latency increases by 15ms
   - Error rate spikes to 0.3%
   - Specific endpoints affected
   - User sessions drop by 2%
   - Revenue impact: -$1,200/hour
3. Automatically generates training data:
   - Pattern: "This code change → This production behavior"
   - Labels: Performance degradation, Revenue impact
   - Context: Load patterns, infrastructure state
```

### Training Data Output
- **Causal Sequences**: What happened, in what order, with what impact
- **Real-World Labels**: Actual business outcomes, not synthetic metrics
- **Production Context**: Load, state, dependencies during events
- **Behavioral Patterns**: How systems actually behave under stress

### Use Cases
- Train ML models on real production behavior
- Predict deployment impacts before rollout
- Identify patterns that lead to incidents
- Optimize for actual business metrics, not just technical ones


AI Training Data Generation

  AFDP creates a framework for generating training datasets that connect code changes to whatever production outcomes matter to YOUR
  system.

  The Opportunity

  Every organization has different production realities:
  - E-commerce: Code → Response time → Cart abandonment → Revenue
  - SaaS: Deployment → API latency → User churn → MRR impact
  - Infrastructure: Change → Resource usage → Scaling events → Cost
  - Your system: Your code → Your metrics → Your outcomes

  What AFDP Provides

  A framework to:
  - Define what production data matters to you
  - Capture cause-and-effect sequences automatically
  - Create training data from YOUR production patterns
  - Maintain cryptographic proof of data authenticity

  The Potential

  This could enable AI models trained on real production behavior rather than synthetic tests. What that means depends entirely on your
   use case - AFDP provides the plumbing, you define the intelligence.

  The key insight: connecting code changes to production outcomes, whatever those outcomes are for your system. The rest is up to you.
