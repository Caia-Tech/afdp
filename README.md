**Enterprise-grade AI deployment pipeline with forensic audit capabilities for regulated industries**

## 🎯 Overview

AFDP is a comprehensive microservices ecosystem designed to provide **forensic-grade audit trails** for AI/ML deployments in regulated environments. The platform enables organizations to deploy AI systems with complete transparency, immutable evidence collection, and multi-framework compliance.

**Status**: Active Development with Initial Implementations

## 🏗️ Architecture

AFDP follows a modular microservices architecture, with each service designed for specific aspects of the AI deployment pipeline:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   AI Systems    │───▶│  AFDP Services  │───▶│  Audit & Log    │
│   (Models/Data) │    │   (Microservices)│    │   Infrastructure │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## 🔒 Security

AFDP is designed with security as a foundational principle:

- **Zero Trust Architecture** - No implicit trust between components
- **End-to-End Encryption** - All communications encrypted in transit
- **Immutable Audit Logs** - Cryptographically signed evidence chains
- **Secure Key Management** - Integration with enterprise HSMs and Vault
- **Memory Safety** - Core services built in Rust to prevent memory vulnerabilities

### Important Security Notes

**⚠️ DEVELOPMENT ONLY**: This repository contains example configurations for development purposes. **Never use default tokens, passwords, or credentials in production environments.**

For production deployments:
- Generate strong, unique authentication tokens
- Enable TLS for all service communications  
- Use proper secret management systems
- Follow the security guidelines in each service's documentation
- Regularly rotate all credentials and keys
