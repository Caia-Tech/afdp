# AFDP Workflow Customization Guide

## üîÑ Design Your Own Intelligence Workflows

AFDP combines **Temporal** (workflow orchestration) with **Git** (cryptographic integrity) to let organizations define exactly HOW they collect production intelligence while maintaining complete auditability.

---

## üéØ Core Concept

Traditional monitoring tools dictate what and how to collect. AFDP lets YOU define:
- **What** to monitor (your metrics, your way)
- **When** to collect (your timing, your patterns)
- **How** to process (your logic, your rules)
- **Where** to store (your data, your control)

All while maintaining forensic-grade integrity of the entire process.

## üîê Integrity Guarantees

### What Temporal Provides
- **Deterministic Execution** - Workflows run exactly as defined
- **Event Sourcing** - Complete history of every step
- **Durable State** - Survives failures and restarts
- **Versioning** - Track workflow evolution over time

### What Git + Notary Add
- **Cryptographic Proof** - Each step is signed and timestamped
- **Immutable History** - Can't change what happened
- **Distributed Verification** - Multiple parties can verify
- **Chain of Custody** - Legal-grade evidence trail

### Combined Result
```
Temporal: "This workflow executed these exact steps"
    +
Git/Notary: "Here's cryptographic proof it happened"
    =
Complete Workflow Integrity
```

## üéÆ Custom Logic Components

### Data Collectors
```yaml
collectors:
  prometheus:
    type: pull
    endpoint: http://prometheus:9090
    query_template: |
      rate(http_requests_total[5m])
      
  custom_database:
    type: sql
    connection: $DATABASE_URL
    query: |
      SELECT COUNT(*) as active_users 
      FROM sessions 
      WHERE last_seen > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
      
  business_api:
    type: rest
    endpoint: https://api.internal/v1/metrics
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN
```

### Analyzers
```yaml
analyzers:
  threshold_checker:
    input: [baseline, current]
    logic: |
      if current.latency > baseline.latency * 1.1:
        return "degradation_detected"
        
  ml_predictor:
    model: deployment_impact_v2
    features:
      - code_change_size
      - deployment_hour
      - current_load
    output: predicted_impact
    
  business_impact:
    correlate:
      - technical_metrics
      - revenue_data
      - user_behavior
    output: financial_impact_assessment
```

### Decision Points
```yaml
decisions:
  auto_rollback:
    condition: revenue_drop > $1000_per_hour
    action: trigger_rollback
    notify: [oncall, management]
    
  alert_only:
    condition: latency_increase > 20ms
    action: send_alert
    severity: warning
    
  all_clear:
    condition: all_metrics_within_normal
    action: mark_successful
    training_label: safe_deployment
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Define Your First Workflow
Start simple - monitor one deployment, one metric:

```yaml
name: my_first_workflow
version: 1.0

workflow:
  - wait_for: deployment
  - capture: response_time
  - wait: 5_minutes
  - capture: response_time
  - compare: before_vs_after
  - store: results
```

### Step 2: Add Business Context
Include what matters to YOUR business:

```yaml
context:
  - user_sessions_active
  - orders_per_minute
  - support_tickets_rate
  - custom_kpi_metric
```

### Step 3: Define Success/Failure
What does "good" look like for you?

```yaml
success_criteria:
  - response_time_increase < 10ms
  - no_increase_in_errors
  - revenue_stable_or_increasing
  - user_satisfaction_maintained
```

---

## üí° Best Practices

### Start Small
- One workflow, one service
- 3-5 metrics maximum
- Simple comparisons
- Expand gradually

### Focus on What Matters
- Business metrics > technical metrics
- User impact > system metrics
- Revenue/conversion > CPU/memory

### Maintain Simplicity
- Workflows should be readable
- Logic should be testable
- Results should be actionable

### Version Everything
- Workflow definitions in Git
- Changes tracked and reviewed
- Evolution documented

---

## üîç Debugging Workflows

### Temporal UI
- See exact execution history
- Identify where failures occurred
- Replay workflows deterministically

### Git History
- Track workflow definition changes
- See who modified what and when
- Understand evolution over time

### Notary Receipts
- Verify data integrity
- Prove workflow execution
- Audit trail for compliance

---

## üéØ Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Stage Deployments
```yaml
stages:
  canary:
    traffic: 1%
    duration: 10_minutes
    abort_on: any_degradation
    
  partial:
    traffic: 10%
    duration: 30_minutes
    abort_on: significant_degradation
    
  full:
    traffic: 100%
    monitor: 1_hour
    rollback_available: 24_hours
```

### Cross-Service Correlation
```yaml
services:
  - api_gateway
  - payment_service
  - user_service
  
correlate:
  - cascade_failures
  - performance_dependencies
  - business_impact_combined
```

### Predictive Workflows
```yaml
before_deployment:
  - analyze_similar_past_deployments
  - predict_likely_impact
  - recommend_deployment_window
  - suggest_rollback_threshold
```
