## 📋 Executive Summary

The AFDP Policy Engine is a security-critical component that enables organizations to define, manage, and execute policies for AI deployment governance. As a fully customizable policy authoring platform, it requires enterprise-grade security controls to protect against policy tampering, unauthorized access, and compliance violations.

This document defines the comprehensive security architecture, threat model, and security controls for the Policy Engine service.

## 🎯 Security Objectives

### Primary Security Goals

1. **Policy Integrity** - Ensure policies cannot be tampered with or corrupted
2. **Access Control** - Restrict policy management to authorized personnel only
3. **Audit Trail** - Maintain complete forensic evidence of all policy changes
4. **Cryptographic Verification** - Enable independent verification of policy decisions
5. **Secure Customization** - Allow safe policy authoring without security vulnerabilities

### Compliance Requirements

- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)** - Financial reporting controls and audit trails
- **HIPAA** - Healthcare data protection and access controls
- **FedRAMP** - Government security standards and continuous monitoring
- **PCI-DSS** - Payment card industry security requirements
- **ISO 27001** - Information security management systems
